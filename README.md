# FINN

FINN is an experimental framework from Xilinx Research Labs to explore deep neural network inference on FPGAs. It specifically targets quantized neural networks, with emphasis on generating dataflow-style architectures customized for each network. The resulting FPGA accelerators are highly efficient and can yield high throughput and low latency. 

FINN runs in a Docker container. (bash ./run-docker.sh notebook)
